# MyReads Project

This is the final assessment project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course. I created a bookshelf app that allows the user to select and categorize books they have read, are currently reading, or want to read . The app also gives user the ability to search for a book and add it to his/her collection



## To get started :

* To run the project, download or clone the repository in your computer
* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`
